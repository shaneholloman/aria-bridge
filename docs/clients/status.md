**Recommended usage**

- Prefer JS/TS in web/Node/RN; Python/Go for service backends; use others for early experimentation only.
- Run the dev one-liner for quick verification; use registry installs once published for app integration.

## Gaps & next steps

### JavaScript / TypeScript

- Stable reference implementation; heartbeat 15s/timeout 30s; exponential backoff 1s→30s; buffering with drop count.
- Gaps: none.

### Roblox / Lua (HTTP)

- State: HTTP polling client for Studio-only dev; batches console/error; polls control requests.
- Gaps: No WebSocket transport; limited reconnect/backoff; Studio-only.

### Python

- State: Heartbeat 15s/30s; reconnect 1s→30s with jitter; buffered sends (200, drop-oldest + notice); control_request/response; parity tests passing locally and in CI (Python 3.11).
- Gaps: Publish to PyPI.

### Go

- State: Heartbeat 15s/30s; reconnect 1s→30s with jitter; buffered sends (200, drop-oldest + notice); control_request/response; parity tests covered in CI (Go 1.22.x on ubuntu-latest). Local macOS run pending here (Go toolchain not installed); prior guidance still recommends `CGO_ENABLED=0` when needed.
- Gaps: Publish tags; keep CI green; document `CGO_ENABLED=0` workaround on macOS if needed.

### PHP

- State: Heartbeat 15s/30s; reconnect 1s→30s with jitter; buffered send (200, drop-oldest + single drop notice); control_request/response; protocol host + PHPUnit tests in repo; CI runs PHPUnit on ubuntu-latest (PHP 8.2). Local run pending (toolchain not available here).
- Gaps: Publish to Packagist; keep CI green; consider dev-friendly defaults toggle like JS; optional local toolchain setup for macOS.

### Ruby

- State: Heartbeat 15s/30s; reconnect 1s→30s with jitter; buffered sends (200, drop-oldest + notice); control_request/response; Node host + Minitest parity tests passing locally and in CI.
- Gaps: Publish gem; keep CI green.

### Rust

- State: Heartbeat 15s/30s; reconnect 1s→30s with jitter; buffered sends (200, drop-oldest + notice); control_request/response; parity tests passing locally and in CI (stable).
- Gaps: Publish crate; consider multi-toolchain CI.

### Swift

- State: Heartbeat 15s/30s; reconnect 1s→30s with jitter; buffered sends (200, drop-oldest + notice); control_request/response; XCTest + Node host; parity tests passing locally and covered by CI on macos-latest.
- Gaps: Publish/tag for SPM consumption; keep CI green.

### Java

- State: Heartbeat 15s/30s; reconnect 1s→30s with jitter; buffered sends (200, drop-oldest + single drop notice); control_request/response; JUnit parity tests covered in CI (Temurin 17). Local run pending on this host due to JDK version.
- Gaps: Publish to Maven Central; consider multi-JDK matrix; logger/redaction for very large payloads.
